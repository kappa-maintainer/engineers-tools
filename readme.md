[`Forge`](http://www.minecraftforge.net/), adding manual tool items
for the Engineer's use.

### Details

The mod has its focus on manual tools:

- *Ore crushing hammer*: Early game ore-to-grit duplication, as known from
  the IE ore crusher. The hammer is crafted like the Engineers Hammer, except
  that one of the two iron ingots is replaced with an iron block. The tool
  has a comparatively low durability and allowed (by default) to crush 64
  stack of ore before breaking. It's not repairable, so a new one has to be
  crafted - or get an IE Ore Crusher machine ASAP.

### Mod pack integration, forking, back ports, bug reports, testing

  - Packs: If your mod pack ***is open source as well and has no installer***,
    you don't need to ask and simply integrate this mod.

  - Bug reports: Yes, please let me know. Drop a mail or better open an issue
    for the repository.

  - Pull requests: Happily accepted. Please make sure that use the ***develop
    branch*** for pull requests. The master branch is for release versions only.
    I might merge the pull request locally if I'm ahead of the github repository,
    we will communicate this in the pull request thread then.

  - The mod config has an "include testing features" option. Enabling this causes
    blocks under development to be registered as well.

### Community references

- [Immersive Engineering](https://github.com/BluSunrize/ImmersiveEngineering/): Without IE, my
  little mod here does not make much sense ;). It works without IE, but - honestly - what's
  an Engineer without her/his machines.
