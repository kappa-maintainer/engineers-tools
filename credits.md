As addon for Immersive Engineering, this mod is heavily inspired
by the designs and the code base of IE, and I would like to give
special credits to the Software Engineers of Immersive Engineering
(BluSunrize, malte0811, et al). Please see:

  - https://github.com/BluSunrize/ImmersiveEngineering/
  - https://github.com/BluSunrize/ImmersiveEngineering/graphs/contributors

Mod components derived/inspired by IE:

  - Crushing hammer: Ore dict recipe registration derived from blusunrize.immersiveengineering.common.IERecipes,
    also providing a mod preference to be compliant to IE.
