As addon for Immersive Engineering, this mod is heavily inspired
by the designs and the code base of IE, and I would like to give
special credits to the Software Engineers of Immersive Engineering
(BluSunrize, malte0811, et al). Please see:

  - https://github.com/BluSunrize/ImmersiveEngineering/
  - https://github.com/BluSunrize/ImmersiveEngineering/graphs/contributors

Mod components derived/inspired by IE:

  - Crushing hammer: Ore dict recipe registration derived from blusunrize.immersiveengineering.common.IERecipes,
    also providing a mod preference to be compliant to IE.


Functionality inspired by Actually Additions

  - The REDIA tool axe-pickaxe-shovel idea is from the Actually Additions
    mod (or at least that's where I saw). I like to credits to Ellpeck
    for this (I added this because I want it meself in IE setups).


Functionality inspired by Botania

  - I was missing Vazkii's Mana-Steel-Pickaxe torch placing in the technical
    mod context, and also the Mana-Shovel hoeing functions so it simply had
    to added. And also here, I have to admit I added the functionality for
    myself in tech packs where Botania does not fit in.
